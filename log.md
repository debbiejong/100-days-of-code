# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**:  Spent time figuring out how GitHub works. Used CodePen to start first Free Code Camp Front End Certification Project using HTML & CSS.

**Thoughts:** Excited to begin this challenge and commit myself to coding at least an hour every day for 100 days. I usually just passively watch and follow online tutorials, so this will be the first time I actually work on projects on my own.
