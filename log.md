# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**:  Spent time figuring out how GitHub works. Used CodePen to start first Free Code Camp Front End Certification Project using HTML & CSS.

**Thoughts:** Excited to begin this challenge and commit myself to coding at least an hour every day for 100 days. I usually just passively watch and follow online tutorials, so this will be the first time I actually work on projects on my own.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**:  Completed first Free Code Camp Front End Development Project, "Build a Tribute Page," using HTML & CSS. [Extra Credit: worked on online tutorials on Codeacademy during my breaks at work!] Started second project, "Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage." 

**Thoughts:** I need to find a better time to code - trying to code in the evenings with my family around, who haven't seen me all day and keep barging in interrupting me, is very distracting. I aim to shift my hour of code from after dinner (~6-7pm) to either later in the evening (~10-11pm when everyone has gone to bed and can't bother me, or even better, ~5-6am before work when definitely no one else is awake). I do feel accomplished, finally coding on my own now. Before, I would always just wait for instructions instead of actively thinking on my own, "how do I do this?" "how can this be solved?" Definitely starting to exercise parts of my coding brain I haven't used yet.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on "Build a Tribute Page," using HTML & CSS. [Extra Credit: worked on online tutorials on Codeacademy during my breaks at work]

**Thoughts:** Struggled with some concepts, since I decided to dive into this coding challenge without a complete Front End Development background. I Googled many of the questions I had, like how to make the text go on the left side and the image on the right while over a background, but the solutions didn't work for my project. Felt more "stumped/stuck" today - this is the first time I'm encountering problems that I can't find direct answers for. Didn't progress much in my project since I kept trying out different methods, but will continue tomorrow!
