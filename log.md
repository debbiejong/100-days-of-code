# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**:  Spent time figuring out how GitHub works. Used CodePen to start first Free Code Camp Front End Certification Project using HTML & CSS.

**Thoughts:** Excited to begin this challenge and commit myself to coding at least an hour every day for 100 days. I usually just passively watch and follow online tutorials, so this will be the first time I actually work on projects on my own.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**:  Completed first Free Code Camp Front End Development Project, "Build a Tribute Page," using HTML & CSS. [Extra Credit: worked on online tutorials on Codeacademy during my breaks at work!] Started second project, "Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage." 

**Thoughts:** I need to find a better time to code - trying to code in the evenings with my family around, who haven't seen me all day and keep barging in interrupting me, is very distracting. I aim to shift my hour of code from after dinner (~6-7pm) to either later in the evening (~10-11pm when everyone has gone to bed and can't bother me, or even better, ~5-6am before work when definitely no one else is awake). I do feel accomplished, finally coding on my own now. Before, I would always just wait for instructions instead of actively thinking on my own, "how do I do this?" "how can this be solved?" Definitely starting to exercise parts of my coding brain I haven't used yet.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on "Build a Personal Portfolio Project," using HTML & CSS. [Extra Credit: worked on online tutorials on Codeacademy during my breaks at work]

**Thoughts:** Struggled with some concepts, since I decided to dive into this coding challenge without a complete Front End Development background. I Googled many of the questions I had, like how to make the text go on the left side and the image on the right while over a background, but the solutions didn't work for my project. Felt more "stumped/stuck" today - this is the first time I'm encountering problems that I can't find direct answers for. Didn't progress much in my project since I kept trying out different methods, but will continue tomorrow!

### Day 4: January 6, 2017 

**Today's Progress**:  Continued working on "Build a Personal Portoflio," using HTML & CSS. [Extra Credit: continued working on online tutorials on Codeacademy during my breaks at work to supplement my knowledge]

**Thoughts:** Struggled a lot today and almost felt like giving up on the challenge. I felt that maybe I was being too ambitious, trying to do these projects before finishing all my online tutorials and being equipped with all the knowledge needed to complete these projects. But when I saw the words of encouragement on comments from complete strangers to my discouraged post on Twitter, I felt cheered and motivated to continue. After all, doing is the best way of learning.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017 

**Today's Progress**:  Continued plowing through the "Personal Portfolio" project. [Extra Credit: finished the "Learn ReactJS: Part 1" course on Codeacademy today! That marks the 18th free course I have finished on Codeacademy =) My goal is to complete all of the available courses on the Codeacademy catalog by the end of January - I only have 5 more courses to complete!]

**Thoughts:** I'm glad the comments and encouragement from strangers boosted my morale to continue my challenge. Alone and struggling, I had the thought of "What's the point? No one cares if I do/finish this or not." But having an invisible but present community of strangers who cheer me on and want me to succeed made me feel a lot better, that I wasn't in this alone. I'm finally understanding why people say that coding is better done in groups and with other people. It can be a lonely process and struggle without a community of like-minded people. To be honest, I'm a bit frustrated and embarrassed by my slow progress on the Personal Portfolio project - but I'll just keep going at it at my own pace, until I figure out the parts that are stumping me.

### Day 6: January 8, 2017 

**Today's Progress**:  started my 19th class on Codeacademy & continued chipping away at the formidable Personal Portfolio Project.

**Thoughts:** Encouraged by the kind words from strangers on my Twitter account! I feel grateful for the anonymous support.

### Day 7: January 9, 2017 

**Today's Progress**:  exhausted from long day at work but managed to squeeze in some HTML & CSS brush-up to help me with my project.

**Thoughts:** It seems silly but today and yesterday I felt less motivated to code because I hadn't gotten any comments, likes, or re-tweets on my daily update tweet. For some reason with the lack of encouragement from others, I felt less motivated to work hard.

### Day 8: January 10, 2017 

**Today's Progress**:  pre-bedtime coding on Codeacademy brushing up on my HTML & CSS foundations.

**Thoughts:** These past few days I've been pretty tired from work and life, and barely manage to squeeze in some time for coding before sleeping. I also need to majorly clean up my desk/work space so I can focus in an uncluttered environment.

### Day 9: January 11, 2017 

**Today's Progress**:  Continued brushing up on my HTML/CSS foundations on Codeacademy during my lunch break to build a better foundation for my projects.

**Thoughts:** Some things I came across during the lessons I had forgotten, and was able to apply to my Personal Portfolio Project to fix some small issues I had been struggling with.
